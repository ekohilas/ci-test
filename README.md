# CI Test
## Evan Kohilas

Helper script to create a static snapshot of jobs for a `.gitlab-ci.yaml`.

Currently, this is setup to take the output of a json created by (gitlab-ci-local)[https://github.com/firecow/gitlab-ci-local] that details the rules for all jobs.

The output generated by this tool can then be used for verifying when particular jobs will be run, or what has changed.
