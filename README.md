# CI Test
## Evan Kohilas

Helper script to output all possible combinations of test jobs for a `.gitlab-ci.yaml`.

Currently, this is setup to take the output of a json created by gitlab-ci-local that details the rules for all jobs.

The output generated by this tool can then be used for verifying when particular jobs will be run.
